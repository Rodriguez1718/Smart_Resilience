I couldn't automatically extract the attached PNG into the repository.

Please save your provided icon image as:

  assets/icon/app_icon.png

Recommended source image:
- PNG
- 1024x1024 pixels
- No rounded corners

After you place the file, run the commands in scripts/update_icons.md to generate platform icons.

If you want me to add the image directly, reply: "Please add the attached image file to the repo" and I'll attempt to write it into `assets/icon/app_icon.png` for you.
